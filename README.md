# CSCI3104
This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Algorithms at CU Boulder.

The focus will be on algorithmic thinking, performance guarantees and boundry cases, efficient solutions to practical problems and understanding how to analyze algorithms. Advanced topics will cover a selection of modern algorithms, many of which come from real-world applications.

List of Topics:
* Asymptotic Analysis
* Time and Space Constraints
* Dynamic Programming
* Divide & Conquer
* Greedy Algorithms
* Graph Algorithms
* Computability

In this Course, Students will:
* become familiar with "standard" algorithms for abstract problem solving
* learn how to mathematically prove properties of algorithms, including correctness
* analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms
* understand the relative merits or demerits of different algorithms in practice
* adapt and combine algorithms to solve problems that may arise in practice
* learn common strategies in the design of new algorithms for emerging applications
